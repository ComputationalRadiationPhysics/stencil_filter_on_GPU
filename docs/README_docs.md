## Motivation

The goal of this project is to develop a stencil kernel for GPUs using [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/). 
As a brief introduction to the various modules needed and a basic stencil code, please have a look at this 
jupyter notebook [`numba_python_kernel_intro.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/stencil_filter_on_GPU/blob/master/numba_python_kernel_intro.ipynb)
