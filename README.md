# Stencil filter on GPU
## A GPU-accelerated stencil for filtering and smoothing using numba

This repository provides a GPU-accelerated stencil filter for open-PMD data. 
At the moment, it is a student project together with the Technische Universität Dresden and 
supervised by the Computational Radiation Physics group of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf. 


Information on installation and usage will follow as soon as the project reaches a suitable state.


At the moment, please consider this project at **work in progess**.
