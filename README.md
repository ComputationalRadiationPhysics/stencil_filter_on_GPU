# Stencil filter on GPU
## A GPU-accelerated stencil for filtering and smoothing using numba

This repository provides a GPU-accelerated stencil filter for open-PMD data. 
At the moment, it is a student project together with the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden and 
supervised by the Computational Radiation Physics group of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf. 


Information on installation and usage will follow as soon as the project reaches a suitable state.


At the moment, please consider this project at **work in progess**.

## TODO List (13.1.2020):

- (1) shared mem. implementation test.                                ==> **done** 
- (2) quick sort with gpu.                                            ==> **impossible in numba**
- (3) read real data with API and test.
- (4) verify the result of cpu implementation and gpu implementation. ==> **done**
- (5) zero-padding implementation.
- (6) profiling.
